                                                         TASK 5-Wireshark Packet Capture 
Step 1: Verified Wireshark Installation (Linux)

Since Wireshark was already pre-installed on my Linux system, I first verified the installation:

1. I opened the terminal.
2. I typed the command: wireshark --version
3. Since Wireshark was installed, the version information was displayed.
4. If Wireshark had not been installed, you can download it from the official Wireshark website or install it through the terminal using:
   sudo apt install wireshark
5. I opened Wireshark by searching for it in the terminal by Running:
   wireshark
you can also open it in the application menu.

Step 2: Selected Network Interface

1.After Wireshark was opened, a list of network interfaces was displayed.
2.These interfaces represented different network devices on my system.
  Any interface chosen had to have an active internet connection and be capable of sending and receiving packets.
3.Since I had connected my mobile hotspot to the laptop, I selected the wlan0 network interface.

Step 3: Started Capturing Traffic

1. Since I clicked on **wlan0**, which was my active network interface.
2. Wireshark was now ready to capture network traffic.
3. I pressed the **Start** button to begin capturing packets.
4. To generate traffic, I opened my browser and visited **testphp.vulnweb.com*.
5. I performed several activities on the website to create more network activity.

Step 4: Stopped the Capture

1. After completing my browsing and searches, I returned to Wireshark.
2. I clicked the **Stop** icon to stop the packet capture.
3. The captured packets were now visible, and I began analyzing the recorded traffic.

Step 5: Filtered Captured Packets by Protocol

1.After capturing network traffic , I applied protocol filters in Wireshark to isolate specific types of packets. 
2.Using the filter bar, I filtered by different protocols such as DNS, ARP, TCP, and HTTP to identify and analyze distinct network behaviors.
3.Wireshark allowed me to easily view packet details, including source/destination addresses, ports, and protocol-specific information.

During the analysis, I successfully identified and captured traffic

Step 6: Protocol Analysis of Captured Packets

After applying protocol-based filters in Wireshark, I analyzed multiple packets from different network layers.
Below is a summarized and structured analysis of the protocols captured during the traffic monitoring session.

🔹 1. DNS (Domain Name System) Packet Analysis

Filter Used: dns

One DNS query packet requested the IPv6 address (AAAA record) for the domain:
Domain Queried: testphp.vulnweb.com
Source IP: 10.131.209.19
Destination IP: 10.131.209.3
Protocol: UDP (Port 53)
Transaction ID: 0x02b8

Summary:
The system attempted to resolve a domain name to an IPv6 address using the DNS server. DNS uses UDP for faster communication.

🔹 2. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Packet Analysis

Filter Used: arp

One ARP reply packet was captured, where a device responded with its MAC address mapping:
Operation: ARP Reply
Sender IP: 10.131.209.19
Sender MAC: f4:4d:08:05:09:38
Target IP: 10.131.209.3
Target MAC: 1a:40:11:89:37:39

Summary:
ARP is used within the local network to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. This ARP reply provided the MAC address of the requesting device.

Screenshot Attached: (ARP Reply)

🔹 3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Packet Analysis

Filter Used: tcp

A TCP SYN-ACK packet was captured, showing part of the TCP three-way handshake:
Source Port: 80
Destination Port: 39128
Flags: SYN, ACK
Sequence Number: 0
Acknowledgment Number: 1

Summary:
This packet indicates the server acknowledging the client’s connection attempt. TCP ensures reliable and ordered communication between devices.

🔹 4. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Packet Analysis

Filter Used: http

A plaintext HTTP POST request was captured:
Method: POST
URL: /userinfo.php
Source IP: 10.131.209.19
Destination IP: 44.228.249.3
Content Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Payload Size: 527 bytes

Summary:
This packet shows the client sending form data to the server over an unencrypted HTTP connection. Since HTTP is not secure, anyone monitoring the traffic could view the transmitted data.

Screenshot Attached: (HTTP POST)

✅ Step 7: Saving & Exporting the Capture File

After analyzing all the packets—including DNS queries, TCP handshakes, HTTP requests/responses, and ARP broadcasts—I saved the entire Wireshark capture for future analysis.

I clicked on:

File → Save As
and exported the packet capture to my system in .pcap format.

This allows me to:
Reopen the capture later for deeper inspection
Use it in network analysis tools
Attach it as evidence or reference for reports
Share it with team members for collaborative investigation

By exporting the file as a .pcap, the full details of the network traffic I filtered and analyzed can be reused for further processing, documentation, or security auditing.

Step 8: Summary of Findings

In this analysis, I examined multiple types of network packets captured in Wireshark, including DNS, TCP, HTTP, and ARP traffic. Each protocol was filtered, reviewed, and summarized individually to understand its purpose, behavior, and role in network communication.

I documented:
DNS queries and responses (AAAA, A records)
TCP three-way handshake packets
HTTP request and response packets
ARP broadcast and reply frames

To provide clear evidence and reference, I also attached all relevant screenshots of the filtered packet views and protocol breakdowns.
These screenshots have been included directly in the repository for easy access and verification.
This completes the packet-level analysis and prepares the dataset for any further investigation, reporting, or security evaluation.
