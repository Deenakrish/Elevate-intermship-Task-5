                                                                                   TASK 5-Wireshark Packet Capture 
Step 1: Verified Wireshark Installation (Linux)

Since Wireshark was already pre-installed on my Linux system, I first verified the installation:

1. I opened the terminal.
2. I typed the command: wireshark --version
3. Since Wireshark was installed, the version information was displayed.
4. If Wireshark had not been installed, you can download it from the official Wireshark website or install it through the terminal using:
   sudo apt install wireshark
5. I opened Wireshark by searching for it in the terminal by Running:
   wireshark
you can also open it in the application menu.

Step 2: Selected Network Interface

1.After Wireshark was opened, a list of network interfaces was displayed.
2.These interfaces represented different network devices on my system.
  Any interface chosen had to have an active internet connection and be capable of sending and receiving packets.
3.Since I had connected my mobile hotspot to the laptop, I selected the wlan0 network interface.

Step 3: Started Capturing Traffic

1. Since I clicked on **wlan0**, which was my active network interface.
2. Wireshark was now ready to capture network traffic.
3. I pressed the **Start** button to begin capturing packets.
4. To generate traffic, I opened my browser and visited **flipkart.com**.
5. I performed several searches on the website to create more network activity.

Step 4: Stopped the Capture

1. After completing my browsing and searches, I returned to Wireshark.
2. I clicked the **Stop** icon to stop the packet capture.
3. The captured packets were now visible, and I began analyzing the recorded traffic.

Step 5: Filter Captured Packets by Protocol

1. In the top "Display Filter" bar, enter a protocol name such as:

   * `http`
   * `dns`
   * `tcp`
   * `icmp`
2. Press **Enter** to apply the filter.
3. Wireshark will now show only packets related to that protocol.

## Step 6: Identify at Least 3 Protocols

During analysis, look for at least three different protocols such as:

* HTTP
* DNS
* TCP
* ICMP
* ARP

---

## Step 7: Export the Capture as a .pcap File

1. Go to **File > Export Specified Packets** or **Save As**.
2. Choose the format `.pcap`.
3. Save the file to your system.

## Step 8: Summarize Your Findings

In your summary, include:

* The protocols you identified.
* What each protocol does.
* Example packet details (source IP, destination IP, protocol type).
* Any unusual or interesting traffic observed.
